## usage

This page is purely for the enjoyment of users. Features some artwork in the background from the film, *Princess Mononoke* to get them in the spirit of the quiz. The theme is in line with the background artwork, bringing a soothing color scheme to the forefront. Users are able to input their initials to go with their scores at the end of the quiz so they can see how they've improved!

## composition

This webpage is composed of 3 different HTML files (one for the opening page, one for the quiz itself, and one for the scoreboard page). A single CSS file unites these HTML files, as their primary components share classes in order to unite their style.

## lessons-learned

While I am finding I am now far more comfortable with CSS, I still have much to learn to begin to develop even a baseline comfort level with JavaScript. There were many moments where I was absolutely certain about how to proceed with my script, and then once I got there, it felt insanely daunting. While I have many technical lessons I've learned and am still learning, the biggest lesson I've taken away from this project is to have some patience with myself.
